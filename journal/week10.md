# Week 10 â€” CloudFormation Part 1

## Note to Andrew

I've been trying to work with Gitpod but for the last few weeks and for some unknown reasons I'm wasn't and still not able to connect to AWS despite hundreds of attempts. I also tried to issue new keys but no success. Had several tickets raised to the support team at Gitpod and through their discord channel chats but this produced no success. So everything here is based on memory, going through the videos again as much as I could and also looking at other peoples journals (not copying/cheatin or plagiarising  - everything here is my own work and words).
In particular I consulted https://github.com/beiciliang/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/week10.md, https://github.com/Rietta1/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/week10.md
So I wasn't able to carry out some further of the functionality implementation or debugging of the frontend. Please take this into account. 
I realised though in the last few days that the work around would have been to manually download the images from AWS and upload them Gitpod but this come to my mind too late to get on with it which is a shame! By this time I wasted so much time with trying to figure out the problem stopping me with everything else. I had a go with Jumppad as you recommended it, installed but the learningcurve to use it in the same way as Gitpod made me decide to learn it at a later stage as I wouldn't have had the time to submit.

When I try to login to ECR I always get:

```html
gitpod /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023 (main) $ ./bin/ecr/login 

An error occurred (404) when calling the GetAuthorizationToken operation: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

```
or when calling

```python

An error occurred (Unknown) when calling the GetCallerIdentity operation: Unknown

```
with no chance to get access to the logs

On this week we worked on CI/CD Pipeline using AWS Cloudformation

##Index of work done

Diagram available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RVzjeaFi76a1buCIZ8vapRjh_isMxNjf/view?usp=sharing)

* [Networking Stack](#networking)

* CI/CD Stack

* Cluster Stack

* 

Networking Stack - CFN Network Template<a name="networking"></a>

We created the networking directory *aws/cfn/networking* with the *config.toml* and the *template.yaml* files

Run *./bin/cfn/networking* command to generate the *CrdNet* stack

The template creates a /16 CIDR VPC with 6 subnets for each private and public, IGW and RT, RT associations and Outputs to be used by other CFN templates.

Can be seen [here](aws/cfn/networking/template.yaml)

Then run the following command *./bin/cfn/networking* to create the *CrdNet* stack



##CI/CD

We created CI/CD directory *aws/cfn/cicd* for the *config.toml* and the *template.yaml* files

Run *./bin/cfn/cicd* command to generate the *CrdCicd* stack

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
#set -e # stop the execution of the script if it fails

CFN_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cicd/template.yaml"
CONFIG_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml"
PACKAGED_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/tmp/packaged-template.yaml"
PARAMETERS=$(cfn-toml params v2 -t $CONFIG_PATH)
echo $CFN_PATH

cfn-lint $CFN_PATH

BUCKET=$(cfn-toml key deploy.bucket -t $CONFIG_PATH)
REGION=$(cfn-toml key deploy.region -t $CONFIG_PATH)
STACK_NAME=$(cfn-toml key deploy.stack_name -t $CONFIG_PATH)

# package
# -----------------
echo "== packaging CFN to S3..."

  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```


## Cluster 

We created *cluster* directory *aws/cfn/cluster* for the *config.toml* and the *template.yaml* files

Run *./bin/cfn/cluster* command to generate the *CrdCluster* stack

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
set -e # stop the execution of the script if it fails

CFN_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cluster/template.yaml"
CONFIG_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cluster/config.toml"
echo $CFN_PATH

cfn-lint $CFN_PATH

BUCKET=$(cfn-toml key deploy.bucket -t $CONFIG_PATH)
REGION=$(cfn-toml key deploy.region -t $CONFIG_PATH)
STACK_NAME=$(cfn-toml key deploy.stack_name -t $CONFIG_PATH)
PARAMETERS=$(cfn-toml params v2 -t $CONFIG_PATH)

aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --s3-bucket $BUCKET \
  --region $REGION \
  --template-file "$CFN_PATH" \
  --no-execute-changeset \
  --tags group=cruddur-cluster \
  --parameter-overrides $PARAMETERS \
  --s3-prefix "cluster" \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
